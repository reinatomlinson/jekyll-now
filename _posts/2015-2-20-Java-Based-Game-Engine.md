title: Java Based Game Engine
---

Searched for a decent Java-based game engine for use as a possible alternative for the project. Aims: 1) animations, 2) collison detection.

Overall a very tight week for me personally. Got a puppy (not really necessary information, but relevant), so time is really stretched even more than usual. Exams, other class work, etc.
Also, Michael and I had a tough time coordinating our schedules this week, so we weren't able to meet and discuss/collaborate on the task. Need to aim higher for the upcoming weeks.

So far, my most promising lead is an engine called JGame. In the README.txt, it states that JGame "features sprites with automatic animation and collision detection," which sounds perfectly suited to the task.
(It is an open-source project, home page at http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/)
