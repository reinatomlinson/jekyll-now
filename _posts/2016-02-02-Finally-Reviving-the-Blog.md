title: Finally Reviving the Blog
---

###One More Time...
Reviving the blog! Designed a logo for my sole proprietorship (Aremte), added my resume. Still a very sparse site. Might need to make more clear that the Github logo at the bottom links to my Github page?
Other than that, have been making great progress! ADR Android is moving along well now. Going to add in the MapScreen that I designed last Spring into the existing Android app. Will be interesting to see the difference in my code! See Github (link at bottom; Github logo) for details and commits.
Going to stick to this blogging!
