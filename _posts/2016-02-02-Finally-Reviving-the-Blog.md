title: Finally Reviving the Blog
---

One More Time...
--------
Reviving the blog! Designed a logo for my sole proprietorship (Aremte), added my resume. Still a very sparse site. Might need to make more clear that the Github logo at the bottom links to my Github page?
Other than that, have been making great progress! ADR Android is moving along well now. Going to add in the MapScreen that I designed last Spring into the existing Android app. Will be interesting to see the difference in my code! See Github (link at bottom; Github logo) for details and commits.
Going to stick to this blogging!

Since last post:
I have been living in Texas and working remotely with Scratchwork Development LLC (Dallas based) to build an Android version of A Dark Room. Progress has been choppy, mostly since I have been setting the schedule myself and adjusting to the move and some other personal events. Progress has been more consistent over the last week.
In addition to A Dark Room, I am working with a local business to design, create, and manage a website for the wholesaling of makeup. The site is still being designed.
