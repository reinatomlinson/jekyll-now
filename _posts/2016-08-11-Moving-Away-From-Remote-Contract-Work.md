Moving Away from Remote Contract Work
--------

Have been applying to a variety of more structured jobs around Texas; I have been feeling that working in an office environment with a work community will be hugely beneficial to me and help round me out as a developer.

Personal projects:
I have been designing and building a mental health application (going to be Android first). Still need to narrow its focus down and decide on a name...

Been rereading my C++ textbook; reassuringly familiar content! Good to review it and brush up on details.

Working at designing a website with an artist in Waco, Texas. Design and implementation. Right now we are picking fonts and I am putting together some mockups for review/feedback. Having a lot of fun with the design side! It's fun to flex my visually creative side again. As part of this, I've been brushing up on my JavaScript.
