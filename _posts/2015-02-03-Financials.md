title: ADR Financials Audit and General Update

After Iteration 2:
--------
Tuesday 10 February
Finished Financials Audit project. After a few kinks (parsing the incorrect units, counting the values incorrectly), had a decent Ruby program to parse and count the monthly income from A Dark Room over the months November 2013- December 2014. The numbers ended up being okay (according to Amir), time to move on! Feeling like I'm getting closer to being caught up, but still struggling a bit.
Downloaded RubyMotion yesterday, workshop tomorrow with Amir.
In the meantime, going to take a look at Oak.
