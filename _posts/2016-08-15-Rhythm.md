Re-discovering the Fun in Apps
--------
Since beginning my personal app project (a mental health application), I've started to experience the fun that comes with development. Not sure why, but that satisfaction fades very fast for me when I'm not keeping it fresh in my mind and practice. I guess it's just like exercise! Always takes about a week or two or awful, awful running before it gets fun again.
BUT, now it's fun again! I'm really enjoying the free development play; but I do know that having more direction soon will help me to sustain that momentum. If left alone too long, I usually run out of steam and direction, or get distracted by a new idea and chase that one for a while.
Basically, I'm enjoying my leisure-development time, but also very much looking forward to working with folks on a common goal again.


Job Hunt
--------
Phone interview this morning. T-minus 74 minutes. Feeling pretty good about it! Going to get out of the house; we're in a phone-service dead zone here. Then have several follow-up calls to make! Gotta be respectful but not too shy. Confidence!

Misc
--------
I kind of miss working from the command line. Might pick that back up, even just doing Git stuff again for starters. Linux?
Need to make sure I don't get too excited and pick up an impossible number of projects.
