Still Trying to Make This a Habit
--------

Working at making this blog a habit! Hoping that it will make me more diligent in general (snowball effect, fingers crossed). Have been playing around on Wix more to de-rust my web development. Also have been practicing SQL. Not sure if I should focus in on one thing (Amir wanted me to stick to F#). Maybe just SQL and web stuff for fun for another week (it's still productive... right?). On that note, here's a great article (thanks, Mom): [Why Procrastinators Procrastintae](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html).
The SQL is coming along easily! Which makes it fun and exciting. It's good to be learning new things again, there's a satisfaction in accomplishing things that I'm eager to dive back into. I hope I can do good things with this.

I do need to spice up this website a bit, too. Probably would do me good to beef up my online presence a bit, right now I'm pretty sure 'Aremte' and 'Reina Tomlinson' pull up some random internet garbage (not very good implicit advertising for someone who claims to know some SEO...).

Am I using this blog incorrectly? Haha.

List for the day:
- SQL studies
- Emails
- Blog tomorrow!!
