title: First Post - Getting set and caught up

Iteration 1:
--------
Getting Ruby, Jekyll blog set up on Github. Ruby came installed on Macbook Pro (January 2015, 256 GB model). Had to use “sudo” to install Ruby gems and update Ruby software. Not feeling entirely confident about if I’m doing this all correctly. Do I wait to install RubyMotion? They said they would get the licenses through the school.

Installed Nodes.js from nodesjs.org:
"Node was installed at
   /usr/local/bin/node
npm was installed at
   /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.”

*************

Finally Jekyll is installed. Had to use “sudo gems install jekyll”; however, when previously using “sudo gems install jekyll”, terminal would tell me:

“Reinas-MacBook-Pro:~ reinatomlinson1$ sudo gem install jekyll

Password:

Fetching: fast-stemmer-1.0.2.gem (100%)

Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:

ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.



    /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/bin/ruby -r ./siteconf20150131-992-ur889n.rb extconf.rb

mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fast-stemmer-1.0.2 for inspection.

Results logged to /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/extensions/universal-darwin-14/2.0.0/fast-stemmer-1.0.2/gem_make.out”



When just using “gems install jekyll” it would tell me:

"Reinas-MacBook-Pro:~ reinatomlinson1$ gem install jekyll

Fetching: fast-stemmer-1.0.2.gem (100%)

ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)

    You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.”



Now I believe Jekyll is installed but there were a couple things that were “skipped”? Unable to convert ASCII to UTF-8… Will look back into it later if it turns out to be a problem. Otherwise, just going to try and keep moving forward to catch up.

Finally feel like I have gotten a foothold in this project. Blog is up, beginning to understand the tools we’re using and how they fit together. Next step is getting comfortable with Ruby; Michael and I are working on the financial audit. So my next step is to do some practice in Ruby and start coding.
